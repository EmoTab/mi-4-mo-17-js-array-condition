//To declare single we use variable but to declare more than one value we need array.
//Array uses third brace to keep many values as packet, it is easy to understand.
//Declaring array is similar as declaring variable. But small change is in value part
/**We need to add 3 things at value part
 * 1. Third brace: []
 * 2. Comma Sign: ,
 * 3. Space (Not mandetory but good practice)
*/
//Declaring number in array
var friendsAge = [11, 21, 45, 17, 14, 105, 6];
// console.log(friendsAge);

//Declaring string in array
var names = ['mahi', 'opu', "shabnor", "shabana"];
// console.log(names);

//We can find the length of values, it will say how many components it contains inside this array
// console.log(friendsAge.length);
// console.log(names.length);


//Array index: Position of array elements called index, starts with 0
